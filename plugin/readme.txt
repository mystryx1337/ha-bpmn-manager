Design, model, simulate, and publish interactive or zero-JS static BPMN 2.0 process workflows directly in WordPress.

== Description ==

**HA-BPMN-Manager** is an enterprise-grade Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) suite designed natively for WordPress. Powered by the industry-standard `bpmn-js` engine by Camunda/bpmn.io, it provides a seamless visual modeling environment directly within wp-admin, alongside powerful interactive viewers and lightning-fast static vector displays for the frontend.

Whether you are managing ISO 9001 quality management (QM) procedures, operational standard operating procedures (SOPs), ITIL service tickets, employee onboarding, or compliance workflows, HA-BPMN-Manager delivers professional process management without requiring third-party SaaS subscriptions.

= Core Features =
  * Blank Start Template
* **Native Gutenberg Block (`ha-bpmn/viewer`):** Visual block selection with live inspector controls for height, mode (interactive vs. static), search, task drawer, and step tracking.
* **Zero-JS Static SVG Mode:** Renders diagrams as server-cached pure SVG vector graphics. No heavy client-side JavaScript bundle loaded – 0ms rendering overhead, 100% SEO-friendly.
* **Interactive Frontend Task Drawer:** Clicking any task or event opens an elegant slide-in drawer displaying assigned roles/lanes, technical IDs, and comprehensive QM instructions from `<bpmn:documentation>`.
* **Live Diagram Search & Highlighting:** Real-time search by task name, documentation, or technical ID with smooth viewport navigation and bright amber visual glow.
* **Process Step Tracker:** Visually highlight current execution stages in real time with animated pulse markers (`active`) and green completion checkmarks (`completed`).
* **Semantic Revision History & Diff:** Compare any two WordPress revisions side-by-side using `bpmn-js-differ` to inspect additions, modifications, and deletions. Revert to any prior version with one click.
* **Automated QM Process Handbook Export:** Generate a print-ready, high-resolution documentation handbook in a new browser tab, complete with process metadata, vector diagram, and tabular task breakdown.
* **Token Simulation:** Interactive step-by-step workflow simulation ("Token Game") with playback controls, speed toggles (1x, 2x), and live simulation log console.
* **Integrated BPMN Linter:** Real-time rule validation (`bpmnlint`) checks diagrams against official BPMN 2.0 modeling standards and flags errors and warnings.
* **Business Color Presets:** Standardized semantic color coding for Happy Paths (Green), Errors/Escalations (Red), Reviews (Yellow), and Systems (Blue).
* **Multi-Instance Support:** Render multiple independent BPMN diagrams on the same page without ID collisions or script interference.
* **Enterprise Security:** Built-in XML External Entity (XXE) protection on file imports, strict user capability checks, and WordPress nonce validation.
* **Subprocess Navigation:** Deep-dive navigation into embedded subprocesses with interactive breadcrumbs.
* **Full Translation Readiness:** Localized into the Top 25 WordPress languages with modern WordPress 6.5+ `.l10n.php` performant translations.

== Installation ==

1. Download `ha-bpmn-manager-v2.5.1.zip` from the release page.
2. In your WordPress Admin dashboard, go to **Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin**.
3. Select the downloaded ZIP file and click **Install Now**.
4. Click **Activate Plugin**.
5. Navigate to the newly created **BPMN Diagrams** menu item in your WordPress admin sidebar to create your first diagram!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I undo an Auto-Layout action? =
Yes! In version 2.5.1, Auto-Layout is fully integrated into the editor's undo stack. Clicking the "Rückgängig" (Undo) button in the toolbar or pressing `Ctrl+Z` (or `Cmd+Z`) immediately reverts the diagram to its exact layout prior to the Auto-Layout. You can also re-apply it using "Wiederholen" (Redo) or `Ctrl+Y`.

= How does the Zero-JS Static SVG Mode work? =
When saving a diagram in the WordPress backend, HA-BPMN-Manager automatically renders and caches the complete SVG vector markup in post metadata. When embedding via `[bpmnm id="123" mode="static"]` or setting the Gutenberg block to "Static SVG", WordPress delivers pure inline SVG markup directly from the server. The ~1.6MB JavaScript bundle is not enqueued at all, resulting in instant load times and perfect Google Lighthouse scores.

= How do I embed a diagram using Gutenberg? =
Simply insert the **BPMN Diagram** block (`ha-bpmn/viewer`). Use the Block Inspector in the right sidebar to select your desired diagram from the dropdown list, adjust container height, toggle interactive features (Search, Drawer, Fullscreen), or set active/completed tracking steps.

= What shortcodes are supported? =
You can use `[bpmnm id="123"]` (or the legacy alias `[bpmn id="123"]`).
Supported shortcode attributes:
* `id` (required): The numeric post ID of the diagram.
* `height`: CSS height value (default: `600px`, e.g. `height="750px"` or `height="70vh"`).
* `mode`: Display mode, either `interactive` (default) or `static`.
* `fullscreen`: `true` (default) or `false` to toggle the fullscreen control.
* `search`: `true` (default) or `false` to toggle live search.
* `drawer`: `true` (default) or `false` to toggle the interactive task details drawer.
* `active`: Comma-separated list of active step IDs or names (e.g. `active="Task_Review"`).
* `completed`: Comma-separated list of completed step IDs (e.g. `completed="StartEvent_1,Task_Submit"`).

= Can I embed multiple diagrams on a single page? =
Yes! HA-BPMN-Manager includes full multi-instance support. Each diagram instance receives an isolated canvas, independent viewport state, unique event bus, and scoped controls.

= How does the Process Step Tracker work? =
By passing `active="Task_ID"` and/or `completed="Task_ID1,Task_ID2"`, the diagram highlights running tasks with an eye-catching amber pulse animation and marks finished tasks with green outlines and checkmark badges. This is ideal for order tracking, ticket lifecycles, and onboarding progress bars!

= Is import protected against malicious XML files? =
Yes. All XML imports (both via file upload and canvas drag-and-drop) are validated through an XXE-hardened parser that forbids external entity expansion (`<!ENTITY`), external DTDs, and remote network access (`LIBXML_NONET`).
